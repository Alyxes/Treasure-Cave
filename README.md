# Treasure-Cave
A small text based, role playing, rogue, dungeon crawler game.

I created the first version of this game in 2023 as a final assignment on Programming 1, a course for learning the basics of C#.
I have extensive prior programming experience from using javascript for years.

The game has a graphical map that the player navigates, even though it's text based, by printing a grid.
Navigating the grid with the arrow keys on the keyboard lets you explore a cave and encounter monsters and find treasure and loot. Also leveling up.
When your character and eventually party of warriors have taken too much damage you must get out of the cave, going into the town and sell loot, rest and heal.
When you die, all progress is gone. But you can save your initial character, load it and use it again.
There are still a small amount of cave rooms, 20 as of now, and when you have found them all the game will crash the next time you enter a new pathway. It's not finished, clearly.
I have a pretty ample description of almost all parts of the game on my site https://www.alyxes.se/, specifically here: https://www.alyxes.se/projects/treasure-cave/
I go through versions there.

This game probably has nothing new in it, hence the No License-license.
I don't care if you use code from this project in your own projects, it's probably not the very best code anyway.
Regarding names. The name of the game isn't exactly smart or imaginative, but some of the names that warriors can be randomized to have are completely from my own imagination.
If you want to use them (and not the obviously borrowed names from movies and other media) I would be glad if you asked first.
The entire game, with name, functionality and basic idea is of course not much to steal, but I would be a little mad if someone releases a game that is obviously just this game with some more stuff and a new name.
Sure, I have the No License, because my game is not really worth stealing and certainly not very unique, but please, just be polite about it.
If you're inspired by my little game and want to borrow ideas or even want to copy code, just talk to me. I will probably help you more than stop you.
